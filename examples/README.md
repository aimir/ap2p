# Examples

This directory contains various examples to help you understand how to use the project. Each example is designed to demonstrate different features and use cases.

## Examples List

- **interconnected_p2p_nodes.py**: runs three interconnected nodes on the different ports on localhost. The nodes are all aware of each other when initialized.
- **extra_p2p_node.py**: running a fourth node, that is only aware of one of the three original nodes, and dynamically discovers and connects to the rest through the peer discovery mechanism.
